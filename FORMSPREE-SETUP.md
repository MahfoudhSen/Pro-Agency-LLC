# 🎉 FORMSPREE INTEGRATION - DONE!

## ✅ What I Did:

I integrated **Formspree** into your website using your endpoint:
`https://formspree.io/f/xrblkypr`

This is **MUCH BETTER** than the other methods! Here's why:

## 🚀 How Formspree Works:

### Super Simple:
1. Customer fills out form
2. Customer clicks "Send Message"
3. **Email automatically sent to: mahfoudhsenhoury@gmail.com**
4. Done! No email client opens!

### What You Receive:

```
From: Formspree <noreply@formspree.io>
